fpALSA is a Free Pascal translation of the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound
Architecture: http://www.alsa-project.org/) library headers. It allows the use
of the ALSA C library from Pascal programs, using Free Pascal
(http://www.freepascal.org/).

This particular version is based on the headers of ALSA 1.0.27.2, and should
work with (at least) fpc 2.4.2 or later. To compile, simply do:

fpc asoundlib

in the src/ directory. No makefiles needed :)

Enjoy!

Hope to see some really cool audio software, written in Pascal for Linux, using
 this little port :)

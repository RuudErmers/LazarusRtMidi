# LazarusRtMidi
RtMidi port for Lazaurus on Raspberry Pi RPI

This One Off Repository hosts a large part of RtMidi ported to Lazarus
and running on the Raspberry Pi.
It is not complete!
There are some memory allocation losses and TMidiIn ports can't be closed
once you've opened them. 
However, I think it is worthy to publish this so you can use it on the Raspberry Pi.
It was tested with a Behringer X-Touch Mini.
Just clone away!
